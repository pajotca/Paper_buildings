By concentrating many of the features promoted by sustainable development advocates, ecodistricts represent an interesting attempt to go beyond the modernist – and unsustainable – vision of the city. In recent years we assisted to an impressive growth of ecodistricts’ labelled projects in European countries and more specifically in Spain. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that in many cases, such urban programmes were mere smoke-screens which badly hided the financing of traditional housing projects with doubtful sustainable content. Assuming that a culturalist explanation in terms of “Mediterranean syndrome” is not acceptable, we argue that the misuse of the “sustainable development label” in Spain is due to a series of institutional mechanisms that generated such situation.},

	abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

At the same time, urban areas offer promising flexibility solutions for balancing variable renewable power. This paper presents models for optimal control of power-to-heat conversion to heating systems and shiftable loads in cities to incorporate large variable renewable power schemes. The power-to-heat systems comprise heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal storage. The control strategies comprise optimal matching of load and production, and cost-optimal market participation with investment analysis. All analyses are based on hourly data. The models are applied to a case study in Helsinki, Finland. For a scheme providing ca. 50\% of all electricity in the city through self-consumption of variable renewables, power-to-heat with thermal storage could absorb all the surplus production. A significant reduction in the net load magnitude was obtained with shiftable loads. Investments to both power-to-heat and load shifting with electric heating and commercial refrigeration have a positive net present value if the resources are controlled cost-optimally.},

Integrating multiple energy carriers and services allow more efficient implementation of these renewables. Although most research efforts so far have focused on the electricity grid, multi-energy systems attract ever more attention. Over the last decades, a wide variety of energy tools has been developed; potentially providing a solid basis to build upon. This paper reviewed those tools specifically able to model multi-energy systems and applicable to a city scale. 13 (of 72 total) are able to and were further analyzed. Challenging is to incorporate short- and long-term dynamics of an energy system. Although some tools combine planning and operational methods, none are able to model solutions that are practically feasible from a grid perspective. Future research aims to integrate the tools re-viewed here with power system simulation models.},

	abstract = {Heat load variations in district heating systems lead to increased costs for heat generation and, in most cases, increased greenhouse gas emissions associated with the marginal use of fossil fuels. This work investigates the benefits of applying thermal energy storage in district heating systems to decrease heat load variations, comparing storage using a hot water tank and the thermal inertia of buildings (with similar storage capacity). A detailed techno-economic optimisation model is applied to the district heating system of Göteborg, Sweden. The results show that both the hot water tank and the thermal inertia of buildings benefit the operation of the district heating system and have similar dynamics of utilisation. However, compared to the thermal inertia of buildings, the hot water tank stores more than twice as much heat over the modelled year, owing to lower energy losses. For the same reason, only the hot water tank is used to store heat for periods longer than a few days. Furthermore, the hot water tank has its full capacity available for charging/discharging at all times, whereas the capacity of the thermal inertia of buildings depends on the heat transfer between the building core and its indoor air and internals. Finally, the total system yearly operating cost decreases by 1\% when the thermal inertia of buildings and by 2\% when the hot water tank is added to the district heating system, as compared to the scenario without any storage.},

	abstract = {Heat demand in a district heating system can have a significant variation within 1day, which produces problematic conditions for efficient heat generation. Short-term thermal energy storage can decrease this daily variation and make the conditions for generating heat more favorable. By periodically overheating and underheating buildings, causing small variations in indoor temperature, building thermal inertia can be utilized for thermal energy storage. This study presents the results from a pilot test where the potential to function as thermal energy storage was tested for five multifamily residential buildings in Gothenburg, Sweden. The signals from the outdoor temperature sensors were adjusted in different cycles during a total of 52weeks. The delivered heat and indoor temperature were measured during the test. The results indicate that heavy buildings, with a structural core of concrete, can tolerate relatively large variations in heat deliveries while still maintaining a good indoor climate. The study also demonstrated that a fixed time constant is not accurate enough to describe the variations in indoor temperature caused by the utilization of the buildings as short-term thermal energy storage. Degree hours is instead proposed as a simple yet adequate measurement for the thermal energy storage capacity in buildings. Storing 0.1kWh/m2floor area of heat will very rarely cause variations in indoor temperature larger than ±0.5°C in a heavy building.},

	abstract = {Thermal energy storage (TES) is widely recognized as a means to integrate renewable energies into the electricity production mix on the generation side, but its applicability to the demand side is also possible. In recent decades, TES systems have demonstrated a capability to shift electrical loads from high-peak to off-peak hours, so they have the potential to become a powerful instrument in demand-side management programs (DSM). Thermal storage is a technology that ensures energy security, efficiency and environmental quality. Of particular interest are applications where TES systems help manage the mismatch between availability of renewable electricity and the demand for electricity in buildings where hot water, heating and cooling are delivered by heat pumps and air conditioning for example. Thus this paper demonstrates the state of the art of present applications of thermal storage for demand-side management. A particular focus of this work is the attention paid to the characteristics of DSM and their relationship to different thermal storage systems. If TES effectiveness for the abovementioned applications is demonstrated, TES devices have a small percentage of the potential market. Therefore challenges and guidelines for a development plan are suggested.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50\% to 80\% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100\% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45\% to 60\% in emissions and from 25\% to 50\% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14\% and 44\% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23\% in emissions, 36\% in primary energy and 11\% in costs. We identified close to 15\% in emissions and 20\% in primary energy savings with variable costs between −2\% and 23\% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4\% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts.},

	abstract = {Recently, demand flexibility has been highlighted as a promising distributed resource from the customer side, especially from industrial customers like commercial buildings, capable of providing grid support services. However, the quantification of demand flexibility is a complex process that requires a methodology including the requirements of both the grid operators and the customers. This paper proposes a novel approach to quantify the available demand flexibility of individual buildings, while taking into account the underlying building energy physics. The proposed approach constructs on the operational flexibility concept from the power systems, and extends it to include a comfort domain, identifying different flexibility parameters with the aim of giving a better insight into the flexibility potential of commercial buildings. This method includes a development of building energy simulations to assess the effects of weather variations, construction types, and comfort constrains on demand flexibility. The proposed quantification method has been validated using 15 different office building models and two different climate zones, i.e., the Netherlands and Texas, US. The results presented in this paper suggest that buildings located in a hot climate could offer higher flexibility potential during shorter time ranges, while buildings in a cold climate could offer lower flexibility potential but during longer time ranges. Determining these differences could potentially facilitate the dispatch of flexible demand resources, to assess their real potential, and to schedule demand flexibility between stakeholders.},

Two lecture theatres, LTH-2 and 3, at the Niger Delta University, Nigeria, were used for the study. Two groups of students from the Faculties of Agriculture and Engineering and the Department of Technology Education constituted the population. The sample size selected through random sampling for Groups A and B was 210 and 370 students, respectively. Objective and self-report instruments were used for data collection. The objective instrument involved physical measurement of the two lecture theatres and of the indoor temperature, relative humidity and air movement. The self-report instrument was a questionnaire that asked for the students perceived indoor thermal discomfort levels and the effect of indoor thermal comfort level on perceived stress behaviours affecting their learning. The objective indoor environmental data indicated thermal discomfort with an average temperature of 29–32 °C and relative humidity of 78\% exceeding the ASHARE [1] and Olgyay [2].The students’ experienced a considerable level of thermal discomfort and also perceived that stress behaviours due to thermal discomfort affected their learning. Further, there were no significant differences in the perceived thermal discomfort levels of the two groups of students in LTH-2 and 3. Furthermore, stress behaviours affecting learning as perceived by the two groups of students did not differ significantly. In addition, no correlation existed between the perceived indoor thermal discomfort levels and stress behaviour levels affecting learning for students in LTH-2, because the arousal level of the students in the thermal environment was likely higher than the arousal level for optimal performance [3,4]. However, a correlation existed in the case of students in LTH-3, which was expected because it only confirmed the widely-accepted view that stress behaviours exhibited by students in any learning can have a profound effect on learning. It was recommended that teaching-learning indoor environment should be thermally comfortable by providing adequate window openings with proper orientation and also by ensuring that the learning space only accommodated the required student capacity to reduce the stress behaviours that affect learning.},

	abstract = {Demand side management (DSM) can be defined as modifications in the demand side energy consumption pattern to foster better efficiency and operations in electrical energy systems. DSM activities, which are classified into “energy efficiency (EE)” and “demand response (DR)” are becoming more popular due to technological advances in smart grids and electricity market deregulation. However, it can be argued that ensuring DSM sustainability requires creating suitable business models. Business models are influenced by different factors such as electricity market regulation, mechanisms, power system characteristics and infrastructure. The proliferation of smart grid infrastructure, distributed generation, intermittent renewable energy resources and energy storage devices has affected DSM business models considerably. Therefore, in this paper, possible business models for EE and DR providers in different electricity market segments are analyzed and reviewed. The analysis covers three types of characteristics: DSM transaction characteristics, renewable energy correlation and DSM load control characteristics. In DSM transaction characteristics, the value proposition of DSM such as added value offered to the DSM purchaser and transaction triggers are discussed. In renewable energy correlation, the effect of increased renewable energy penetration on the business model is evaluated. In DSM load control characteristics, load control and aggregation aspects such as response speed, duration, advance notice, location sensitivity and actual usage frequency are analyzed.},

Hence, it is in a current state of transition between the traditional approach to power generation and distribution, where end-consumers of electricity have typically been inactive in their involvement with energy markets and a new approach that integrates their active participation. This new approach includes the use of distributed energy resources (DER) such as renewable-based generation and demand response (DR), which are being rapidly adopted by end-consumers where incentives are strong. This paper presents the role of the DR aggregator to effectively integrate DER technology as a new source of energy capacity into electricity networks using information communication technology and industry knowledge., Based on DR aggregators, this framework will efficiently facilitate renewable energy integration and customer engagement into the electricity market. To this aim, advantages and disadvantages of DR aggregators are discussed in this paper from political, economic, social, and technological (PEST) points of view. Based on this analysis, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis for a typical DR aggregator is presented.},

	abstract = {In the context of the Energy Internet, customers are supplied by energy hubs (EH), while the EHs are interconnected through an upper-level transmission system. In this paper, a stochastic scheduling model is proposed for the interconnected EHs considering integrated demand response (DR) and wind variation. The whole integrated energy system (IES) is linearly modeled for the first time. The output-input relationship within the energy hub is denoted as a linearized matrix, while the upper-level power and natural gas transmission systems are analyzed through piecewise linearization method. A novel sequential linearization method is further proposed to balance computational efficiency and approximation accuracy. Integrated demand response is introduced to smooth out demand curve, considering both internal DR achieved by the optimal energy conversion strategy within energy hubs, and external DR achieved by demand adjustment on the customer\&rsquo;s side. Distributed energy storage like natural gas and heat storage are considered to provide buffer for system operation. The proposed stochastic model is solved by scenario-based optimization with a backward scenario reduction strategy. Numerical tests on a three-hub and seventeen-hub interconnected system that validates the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model and solution methodology.},

At the same time, urban areas offer promising flexibility solutions for balancing variable renewable power. This paper presents models for optimal control of power-to-heat conversion to heating systems and shiftable loads in cities to incorporate large variable renewable power schemes. The power-to-heat systems comprise heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal storage. The control strategies comprise optimal matching of load and production, and cost-optimal market participation with investment analysis. All analyses are based on hourly data. The models are applied to a case study in Helsinki, Finland. For a scheme providing ca. 50\% of all electricity in the city through self-consumption of variable renewables, power-to-heat with thermal storage could absorb all the surplus production. A significant reduction in the net load magnitude was obtained with shiftable loads. Investments to both power-to-heat and load shifting with electric heating and commercial refrigeration have a positive net present value if the resources are controlled cost-optimally.},

	abstract = {As demand response and energy flexibility are often suggested as key principles to facilitate high levels of renewable energy sources into energy markets, different studies evaluated the potential impact of energy flexibility in buildings. Nonetheless, due to differences in definition and quantification methodologies for energy flexibility, comparing results between such studies is difficult. With a review and applied evaluation of existing definitions and quantification methodologies this paper aims at assessing the applicability, benefits and drawbacks of each quantification methodology. The conducted review shows that energy flexibility definitions found in the literature have their particularities despite sharing the same principle that energy flexibility is the ability to adapt the energy profile without jeopardizing technical and comfort constraints. The survey of quantification methodologies reveals two main approaches to quantify energy flexibility. A first approach quantifies energy flexibility indirectly using past data and assuming a specific energy system and/or energy market context. The second approach directly predicts the energy flexibility that a building can offer to the energy system in a bottom-up manner. While applications for both approaches were identified, this paper focuses on the latter. By applying methodologies that follow this second approach to a common case study, three common properties of energy flexibility were observed: i) the temporal flexibility; ii) the amplitude of power modulation; iii) and the associated cost.},

This paper presents a literature review focussing on the reported impacts of building thermal inertia on thermal comfort and energy use for space heating and cooling. A wide range in research methods, building types and climatic conditions considered by the respective authors, contributes to a large spread in research outcomes. As a general tendency it can be concluded that for most buildings and climates, higher amounts of thermal mass at the inner side of the thermal insulation appear to be beneficial with regard to improving thermal comfort and reducing the energy demand. The impact on energy demand is however relatively small. With an order of magnitude of a few percent for most cases, other design parameters such as thermal insulation of the building envelope and solar heat gains will be more significant. The paper reviews some practical applications exploiting the effect of thermal inertia in design and operation of HVAC systems, and concludes with a discussion on the apparent discrepancy in simulation outcomes and suggestions for further research.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the potential of buildings to modulate the heating power and define simple control strategies to exploit the flexibility potential considering both energy and thermal comfort. Two residential buildings with different levels of insulation and air-tightness have been modelled. This wide range of thermal properties covers the global performance of the residential building stock, and does not only focus on state-of-the-art buildings. Two strategies of modulation have been investigated: heat storage (i.e. increase of set-point) and heat conservation (i.e. decrease of set-point). Additionally, the effect of the time of activation and the type of emitter (radiator or underfloor heating) has been evaluated. A better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of buildings has been achieved in this paper. Contrary to other storage solutions (e.g. battery, hot water tank), the modulation potential of the thermal mass depends on several factors (level of insulation, type of emitter, etc) and varies over time (cold vs. transition season). The autonomy of a poorly-insulated building is relatively short, whereas passive houses have a long time constant. This characteristic implies differences in the control strategy to make use of the flexibility potential without violating comfort.},

In a departure from past studies which are often biased towards power systems performance, this paper presents key building performance implications when used within the context of electricity demand-side management (DSM) programs to provide power systems flexibility services to the smart-grid. Focusing on office buildings and using an average-sized office building as test-bed, their potential as a source of demand-side flexibility in terms of building specific parameters such as power demand, energy consumption, limits of operational flexibilities, systems’ response times, indoor comfort, comfort recovery time and availability are evaluated and discussed. Analysis of field study data demonstrates that office buildings could effectively serve as a source of power flexibility. However, variation in indoor air quality and thermal comfort performance across various zones within the building may complicate estimation of demand side flexibility potential, its acceptability and operation at building level.

The service consists of a power modulation, upward or downward, that is activated at a given time period over a fixed number of periods. The service modulation is relative to an optimized baseline that minimizes the energy costs. The load modulation is directly followed by a constrained rebound effect, consisting of a delay time with no deviations from the baseline consumption and a payback time to return to the baseline state. The potential amount of modulation and the constrained rebound effect are computed by solving mixed integer linear problems. Within these problems, the thermal behavior of the building is modeled by an equivalent thermal network made of resistances and lumped capacitances. Simulations are performed for different sets of buildings typical of the Belgian residential building stock and are presented in terms of achievable modulation amplitude, deviations from the baseline and associated costs. A cluster of one hundred ideal buildings, corresponding to retrofitted freestanding houses, is then chosen to investigate the influence of each parameter defined within the service. Results show that with a set of one hundred heat pumps, a load aggregator could expect to harvest mean modulation amplitudes of up to 138kW for an upward modulation and up to 51kW for a downward modulation. The obtained values strongly depend on the proposed flexibility service. For example, they can decrease down to 2.6kW and 0.4kW, respectively, if no rebound effect is allowed.},

	abstract = {Domestic heating has a large share in the UK total energy consumption and significant contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions since it is mainly fulfilled by fossil fuels. Therefore, decarbonising the heating system is essential and an option to achieve this is by heating system electrification through heat pumps (HP) installation in combination with renewable power generation. A potential increase in performance and flexibility can be achieved by pairing HP with thermal energy storage (TES), which allows the shifting of heat demand to off peak periods or periods with surplus renewable electricity. We present a design and operational optimisation model which is able to assess the performance of HP–TES relative to conventional heating systems. The optimisation is performed on a synthetic heat demand model which requires only the annual heat demand, temperature and occupancy profiles. The results show that the equipment and operational cost of a HP system without TES are significantly higher than for a conventional system. However, the integration of TES and time-of-use tariffs reduce the operational cost of the HP systems and in combination with the Renewable Heating Incentive make the HP systems cost competitive with conventional systems. The presented demand model and optimisation procedure will enable the design of low carbon district heating systems which integrate the heating system with the variable renewable electricity supply.},

The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions.

Currently, there is no insight into how much flexibility a building may offer, and this study aims to overview the theoretical approaches and existing indicators to evaluate the Energy Flexibility of building clusters. The focus on cluster scale allows for the exploitation of the variation in energy consumption patterns between different types of buildings and the coordination of load shifting for the improvement of renewable energy use.

	abstract = {Simple, reliable building models have been receiving quite a bit of attention recently particularly with regard to diverse applications, such as building design for inexpert energy modellers, simulation of neighbourhood or city districts and model predictive control. The International Standard ISO 13790 and the German Guideline VDI 6007 use two different lumped-capacitance models (5R1C and 7R2C, respectively) based on deterministic, analytical procedures to identify their parameters. The current work investigates the suitability of these models in calculating peak loads and seasonal energy needs and their accuracy in estimating buildings’ dynamic behaviour. A room and an apartment were thus simulated using simplified models and with the benchmarked software TRNSYS. Four reference envelopes with different thermal insulation and heat capacities were examined in four climatic conditions. Each of the models was able to estimate quite precisely energy needs in both the heating and cooling modes, although the 7R2C model was slightly more accurate. The 5R1C model was, however, unable to follow the thermal response of the buildings during the cooling season, which in turn implied a systematic underestimation of the cooling peak load. The 7R2C model identified a significant reduction in the root mean squared error (RMSE) both in the indoor air temperature and in the heating/cooling loads with respect to the reference profiles. That model would seem then more suitable for the dynamic simulation of single thermal zones with hourly time steps in both heating and cooling modes.},

	abstract = {A large share of the energy is consumed in buildings but at the individual scale, the energy consumption is rarely optimized; as a consequence, energy is wasted, electricity consumption is characterized by peaks and renewable energy integration is hindered. The quantification of the impact of a better energy management is a first step towards the deployment of load management techniques. This paper addresses the estimation of the thermal load management potential in buildings at a large scale. It presents a replicable methodology consisting of three steps to address the challenges of data collection, model development and thermal load optimization. The current work aims at addressing, within a single tool, various energy vectors, building types and stakeholders expectations. Application of this methodology has been initiated on an urban case study (Geneva, Switzerland) and preliminary results are presented in the paper.},

	abstract = {In order to avoid grid instability and decreasing production efficiencies of large power plants due to a widespread integration of renewable electricity production, demand-side management (DSM) is proposed as a solution to overcome the possible mismatch between demand and supply. This research evaluates the potential to improve the balance between the electricity use for heating and local electricity production of a nearly zero energy building (nZEB), by active use of structural thermal storage capacity of the building. To quantify the DSM potential of structural thermal storage, the cover factors and peak electricity demand of a single family dwelling equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) system are chosen. Detailed representations of the PV system and the dwelling itself, heated by an air–water heat pump, are implemented in the modeling environment of Modelica and simulated for the heating-dominated climate of Belgium. The influence of the insulation level and the embedded thermal mass of the construction on the DSM potential is evaluated. The impact of the heat emission system is estimated by comparing a floor heating system with a radiator emission system. Results show that although the influence on the cover factors is limited, the use of the structural storage capacity for demand-side management shows strong potential to shift the peak electricity use for heating to off-peak hours. Furthermore, it is shown that not only the availability of the thermal mass, but also the interaction between the heating system and the thermal mass is of significant importance.},

	abstract = {The smart grid paradigm implies flexible demand and energy storage in order to cope with the variability of renewable energy sources. Buildings are often put forward as a potential supplier of flexibility services through demand side management (DSM) and distributed energy storage, partly as thermal energy. This paper presents a bottom-up approach for the quantification of this flexibility service. Cost curves are computed from the solution of optimal control problems with low-order models. These curves show the amount of flexibility and their associated cost. The method is generic and can be applied to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) services, thermal energy storage (TES) and local electricity production. A case study is performed on a monitored office building in Brussels, Belgium. The results reveal a large variation in both flexibility and cost depending on time, weather, utility rates, building use and comfort requirements. The study shows that for the studied day, flexibility is not for free. The mean flexibility cost has the same order of magnitude as the imbalance price in the Belgian power system.},

A distinction was drawn between rule-based controls (RBC) and model predictive controls (MPC), given the clear differences in their concept and complexity. For both kinds, the different objectives claimed by these strategies have been reviewed, as well as the control inputs, disturbances and constraints. Notably in MPC, the monetary objective (reduction of the energy costs) has been the most utilized in the literature, therefore the authors advocate for the further study of other objectives related to energy flexibility. Further than the control strategies themselves, the different thermal storage options (necessary to activate the flexibility) have also been reviewed, the built-in thermal mass seeming more cost-effective than water buffer tanks in this regard. Based on these conclusions, recommendations for further research topics are drawn.},

	abstract = {Heat pumps are seen as a promising technology for load management in the built environment, in combination with the smart grid concept. They can be coupled with thermal energy storage (TES) systems to shift electrical loads from high-peak to off-peak hours, thus serving as a powerful tool in demand-side management (DSM). This paper analyzes heat pumps with radiators or underfloor heating distribution systems coupled with TES with a view to showing how a heat pump system behaves and how it influences the building occupants' thermal comfort under a DSM strategy designed to flatten the shape of the electricity load curve by switching off the heat pump during peak hours (16:00–19:00). The reference scenario for the analysis was Northern Ireland (UK). The results showed that the heat pump is a good tool for the purposes of DSM, also thanks to the use of TES systems, in particular with heating distribution systems that have a low thermal inertia, e.g. radiators. It proved possible to achieve a good control of the indoor temperature, even if the heat pump was turned off for 3 h, and to reduce the electricity bill if a “time of use” tariff structure was adopted.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration level of renewable energy requires more flexibility measures to be implemented in future energy systems. Integrating an energy consumer’s local energy supplies connects multiple energy networks (i.e., the electrical grid, the district heating network, and gas network) in a decentralized way. Such integration enhances the flexibility of energy systems. In this work, a Swedish office building is investigated as a case study. Different components, including heat pump, electrical heater, battery and hot water storage tank are integrated into the electricity and heat supply system of the building. Special focus is placed on the flexibility that the studied building can provide to the electrical grid (i.e., the building modulates the electricity consumption in response to the grid operator’s requirements). The flexibility is described by two metrics including the flexibility hours and the flexibility energy. Optimization of the component capacities and the operation profiles is carried out by using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The results show that the system fully relies on electricity for the heat demand when not considering the flexibility requirements of the electrical grid. This suggests that district heating is economically unfavorable compared with using electricity for the heat demand in the studied case. However, when flexibility requirements are added, the system turns to the district heating network for part of the heat demand. The system provides great flexibility to the electrical grid through such integration. The flexibility hours can be over 5200 h in a year, and the flexibility energy reaches more than 15.7 MWh (36\% of the yearly electricity consumption). The yearly operation cost of the system slightly increases from 62,273 to 65,178 SEK when the flexibility hours increase from 304 to 5209 h. The results revealed that flexibility can be provided from the district heating network to the electrical grid via the building.},

Such integration enhances the flexibility of energy systems. In this work, a Swedish office building is investigated as a case study. Different components, including heat pump, electrical heater, battery and hot water storage tank are integrated into the electricity and heat supply system of the building. Special focus is placed on the flexibility that the studied building can provide to the electrical grid (i.e., the building modulates the electricity consumption in response to the grid operator’s requirements). The flexibility is described by two metrics including the flexibility hours and the flexibility energy. Optimization of the component capacities and the operation profiles is carried out by using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The results show that the system fully relies on electricity for the heat demand when not considering the flexibility requirements of the electrical grid. This suggests that district heating is economically unfavorable compared with using electricity for the heat demand in the studied case. However, when flexibility requirements are added, the system turns to the district heating network for part of the heat demand. The system provides great flexibility to the electrical grid through such integration. The flexibility hours can be over 5200 h in a year, and the flexibility energy reaches more than 15.7 MWh (36\% of the yearly electricity consumption). The yearly operation cost of the system slightly increases from 62,273 to 65,178 SEK when the flexibility hours increase from 304 to 5209 h. The results revealed that flexibility can be provided from the district heating network to the electrical grid via the building.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of buildings is a complex task involving energy systems as well as construction measures. Typically, in exact optimization models, only energy systems are considered, whereas envelope components are neglected. When considering both, heuristics are commonly used, which do not guarantee optimal or close to optimal results. Thus, this paper presents the governing equations, validation and exemplary usage of a building model suitable for exact optimization problems. The developed model simultaneously considers energy systems and building envelopes. It is based on ISO 13790 and validated according to ASHRAE 140 and further compared to a more detailed model. The findings show that the developed model largely complies with the ASHRAE requirements and is able to assess buildings’ dynamic behavior regarding indoor air temperatures as well as hourly, peak load, and annual heating loads. The simultaneous optimization of energy system and envelope is further demonstrated analyzing retrofitting options of a residential building. We consider solely installing additional PV units, modernizing the building envelope according to German regulations and an optimization without constraints regarding building envelope and energy system. The results indicate that installing additional PV units can moderately reduce total costs and CO2 emissions. The envelope modernization according to governmental regulations leads to largely increased costs at lower emissions, whereas the unconstrained optimization is able to simultaneously achieve significant cost and CO2 emission advantages.},

	abstract = {In order to avoid grid instability and decreasing production efficiencies of large power plants due to a widespread integration of renewable electricity production, demand-side management (DSM) is proposed as a solution to overcome the possible mismatch between demand and supply. This research evaluates the potential to improve the balance between the electricity use for heating and local electricity production of a nearly zero energy building (nZEB), by active use of structural thermal storage capacity of the building. To quantify the DSM potential of structural thermal storage, the cover factors and peak electricity demand of a single family dwelling equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) system are chosen. Detailed representations of the PV system and the dwelling itself, heated by an air–water heat pump, are implemented in the modeling environment of Modelica and simulated for the heating-dominated climate of Belgium. The influence of the insulation level and the embedded thermal mass of the construction on the DSM potential is evaluated. The impact of the heat emission system is estimated by comparing a floor heating system with a radiator emission system. Results show that although the influence on the cover factors is limited, the use of the structural storage capacity for demand-side management shows strong potential to shift the peak electricity use for heating to off-peak hours. Furthermore, it is shown that not only the availability of the thermal mass, but also the interaction between the heating system and the thermal mass is of significant importance.},

They can be coupled with thermal energy storage (TES) systems to shift electrical loads from high-peak to off-peak hours, thus serving as a powerful tool in demand-side management (DSM). This paper analyzes heat pumps with radiators or underfloor heating distribution systems coupled with TES with a view to showing how a heat pump system behaves and how it influences the building occupants' thermal comfort under a DSM strategy designed to flatten the shape of the electricity load curve by switching off the heat pump during peak hours (16:00–19:00). The reference scenario for the analysis was Northern Ireland (UK). The results showed that the heat pump is a good tool for the purposes of DSM, also thanks to the use of TES systems, in particular with heating distribution systems that have a low thermal inertia, e.g. radiators. It proved possible to achieve a good control of the indoor temperature, even if the heat pump was turned off for 3 h, and to reduce the electricity bill if a “time of use” tariff structure was adopted.},

A method for analyzing the flexibility that is needed to maintain the stability of the electrical grid is presented followed by the restrictions that are caused by meeting the heat demand and satisfying the comfort criteria of the residents. Approaches for simultaneously fulfilling these constraints as well as matching the flexibility needs of the electrical grid and the flexibility provided by the local building energy systems are discussed. To enhance the analysis options for the shown systems, a simulation platform that covers the electrical grid simulation, the building systems’ simulation and the control strategies is presented. This platform can be used to analyze different scenarios of building energy systems with different penetrations of renewable energy sources and different building types.},

	abstract = {Urban building energy models aspire to become key planning tools for the holistic optimization of buildings, urban design, and energy systems in neighborhoods and districts. The energy demand of buildings is largely influenced by the behavior of the occupants. The insufficient consideration of occupant behavior is one of the causes to the “performance gap” in buildings - the difference between the simulated and the actually observed energy consumption. On the urban-scale impacts of different occupant behavior modeling approaches onto the various purposes of urban building energy models are still largely unknown. Research shows that the inappropriate choice of occupant behavior model could result in oversized district energy systems, leading to over-investment and low operational efficiency. This work therefore reviews urban building energy models in terms of their occupant behavior modeling approaches. Three categories of approaches are established and discussed: (1) deterministic space-based approaches, (2) stochastic space-based approaches, and (3) stochastic person-based approaches. They are further assessed in terms of their strategy to consider diversity in occupant behavior. Stochastic models, especially stochastic person-based models, seem to be superior to deterministic models. However, there are no stochastic models available yet that can be used for case studies of mixed-districts, comprising buildings of various occupancy types. In the reviewed urban-scale approaches, only single-use type districts (residential or office) are modeled with stochastic techniques. However, people interact with various buildings on a daily basis. Their activities relate to their presence in different spaces at the urban-scale and to their use of appliances in those spaces. Their individual levels of comfort and behavioral patterns govern the control actions towards building systems. Therefore, a novel activity-based multi-agent approach for urban occupant behavior modeling is proposed as alternative to current approaches.},

Geographical information models and systems can provide input data to quantify the district energy demand, but the available levels of detail (LOD) of these data vary significantly between regions. Therefore, this work investigates the usability of LOD1 and LOD2 representations as well as the impact of building geometry within district energy simulations, by quantifying the differences in geometrical and energy characteristics between five variants of LOD1 or LOD2 representations. The most detailed LOD2 representation is thereby used as a reference. The results show that the significantly decreasing accuracy using LOD1 models may be compensated by assuming the roof shape from regional statistics. Also, aggregation of wall and roof components into a limited number of orientations significantly reduces simulation time, while maintaining the accuracy. It is concluded that geographical information models contain a significant amount of useful data, but the error that results from the deployed level of detail must be kept in mind when assessing the simulation results.},

This framework aims to find optimum system configurations and operation signals for any given equipment options, and load- and weather-profiles. The framework is presented through a case study on an oceanic container transportation application. Optimized system configurations and operation signals are found under three different scenarios: minimizing life cycle cost as single objective, minimizing capital cost and annual fuel energy consumption as bi-objective, and minimizing life cycle cost considering uncertainties in load profiles. The optimized system could reduce system life cycle cost by 40\% in single objective scenario and 45–52\% at different levels of robustness. Exploring waste heat from the main ship propulsion engine is the key to reduce life cycle cost. The framework can be applied for a wide range of applications as an efficient tool to search for novel system designs and their evaluations.},

The optimization is developed between 2016 and 2035 using ANSWER-TIMES energy planning simulation program taking 2015 as the base year. The results show that by internalizing external costs renewable energy power plants are promoted in long term. The fossil fueled power plants are primarily preferred to meet the demand when the external costs of electricity generation are not considered during optimization. The scenario results also presented that the total discounted costs increase by 4\% for CO2 mitigation scenario relative to BAU scenario when external costs are not considered in optimization. However, total discounted system costs are increased by about 30\% for both CO2 mitigation and BAU scenarios when external costs are considered in optimization.

Performance models simulate energy outputs with system configurations specified by the user, while optimization models can help plan appropriate system sizes to meet energy goals such as minimizing life-cycle system costs or maximizing carbon reduction. The models reviewed in this paper have been categorized into different project level subgroups: ‘Multi-scale Renewable Energy (RE) Tools’, ‘District Level Tools’, and ‘Regional Level Tools’. The tools in each category will be compared to one another to show similarities and differences. Concluding this research, a summary of which tools are more suitable for each scale will be suggested.},

	abstract = {In the last years the total energy consumption of data centre industry has experienced a rapid increase due to the vast growth in internet usage. This phenomenon has aroused the interest for both, data centre industry and researchers in energy consumption and carbon footprint mitigation. Data centres operational expenses are also a key parameter for the productivity and competitiveness of the industry. In the present work, the implementation and optimization of thermal energy storage (TES) into a real data centre is presented. To the knowledge of the authors this is the first time that a methodology based on TraNsient System Simulation (TRNSYS), GenOpt and the application of Hooke and Jeeves optimization algorithm is used to study the implementation of TES, in particular water storage tanks, in data centres. A sensitivity analysis on the TES system cost is performed in function of the available literature information. The results show that the operating temperature of the chillers should be as lower as the system allows and therefore this open the possibility to study ice storage system. Regarding the economic analysis, the data centre electricity expenses can be reduced annually up to 3\%. The uncertainty of the electricity price in the future is a major issue and it is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Modern district energy systems are highly complex with several controllable and uncontrollable variables. To effectively manage a multi-vector district requires a holistic perspective in terms of both modelling and optimisation. Current district optimisation strategies found in the literature often consider very simple models for energy generation and conversion technologies. To improve upon the state of the art, more realistic and accurate models must be produced whilst remaining computationally and mathematically simple enough to calculate within short periods. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of modelling techniques for common district energy conversion technologies including Power-to-Gas. In addition, dynamic building modelling techniques are reviewed, as buildings must be considered active and flexible participants in a district energy system. In both cases, a specific focus is placed on artificial intelligence-based models suitable for implementation in the real-time operational optimisation of multi-vector systems. Future research directions identified from this review include the need to integrate simplified models of energy conversion units, energy distribution networks, dynamic building models and energy storage into a holistic district optimisation framework. Finally, a future district energy management solution is proposed. It leverages semantic modelling to allow interoperability of heterogeneous data sources to provide added value inferencing from contextually enriched information.},

Appropriate planning tools are necessary to guide this transition towards more energy efficient system designs. Thus, the aim of this paper is to present workflow automation approaches to model buildings and district energy systems for dynamic simulation and integral system analyses. For data collection and management, we use a Geographic Information System coupled with a PostgreSQL database. In this paper, we present the software tools TEASER and uesmodels which use this data to automatically generate dynamic building and district energy system models in the modeling language Modelica. To demonstrate the application of these tools for workflow automation, we analyze a university campus with 39 buildings. In one scenario, an optimization led to an improved heating curve, with which yearly primary energy demand in the model was reduced by 0.9\%. In a second scenario, the retrofitting of all building envelopes in the district energy system reduced primary energy demand by 16.0\%. These examples showed that the presented approach is suited to evaluate options for improving district energy system, ranging from improved operation to changes in system design, and a combination of both.},

Dans le but de réduire l’empreinte énergétique d’un quartier dès la phase de conception, un ensemble de contributions a été réalisé afin d’accompagner les aménageurs dans cette démarche. La plateforme de simulation DIMOSIM (DIstrict MOdeller and SIMulator) a été développée pour modéliser et simuler dynamiquement les flux énergétiques d’un quartier implanté au sein de son environnement urbain. La conception est optimisée à l’aide d’une procédure multiobjectif combinant les aspects énergétiques, économiques et environnementaux pour garantir la meilleure performance globale. Cette approche transversale est multi-étagée et intègre l’algorithme génétique NSGA-II afin de s’adapter aux spécificités du problème. La sélection de la solution préférentielle est ensuite facilitée par l’utilisation d’une méthode d’analyse multicritère de surclassement qui a été conçue dans le but de fournir une évaluation détaillée des différents concepts : la méthode ATLAS (Assistance TooL for decision support to Assess and Sort). Enfin, la procédure complète d’accompagnement a été appliquée à des projets de conception d’écoquartier pour en valider le fonctionnement mais également pour fournir l’aide à la décision nécessaire aux décideurs.},

The thermal comfort feeling is influenced by environmental and personal factors. Its most commonly used indicator is the air temperature, which, alone, is not a valid indicator of thermal stress. Thermal comfort should be measured by the number of people complaining of thermal discomfort. There are several procedures to assess the thermal comfort, but they require the measurement of many variables. This paper aims to propose a procedure to assess the thermal comfort. This proposal includes the creation of a ratio scale and a set of statistical procedures to treat the data gathered from this scale. This procedure was used to evaluate the influence of fans in the thermal comfort feeling of the occupants of a small office, and it proved to be useful. This procedure makes easier the inclusion of the human in the control loop of the comfort systems.},

	abstract = {The integration of multiple energy systems (MES) provides opportunities to explore the flexibility to accommodate more renewable energy. The concept and methodology of energy hub (EH) enable the standardized modeling of district MES. However, current EH formulations introduce nonlinearities into the modeling and present challenges to analysis and optimization. This paper proposes an automatic and linearized modeling method to formulate energy conversion in EHs, which simplifies the optimization of EH operations. On this basis, the flexibility of an EH is analyzed and quantitatively evaluated based on the ranks of the coupling matrices of the EH and its feasible operational region. Finally, an application of the linearized model on the interval optimization model is illustrated to show how it can suppress uncertainties and fluctuations in distributed renewable energy. A case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the rationality of the flexibility analysis by comparing two EHs with different flexibilities.},

	abstract = {Recent studies in the literature have shown that cooperative energy management of an aggregation of buildings may lead to substantial energy savings. These approaches typically assume the existence of a central operator that is capable of formulating and solving, within a reasonable amount of time, a centralized optimization problem. However, this requirement may be unrealizable in cases of large scale districts, and it also fails to address privacy concerns of the building occupants. In this paper, we deal with these issues by proposing a decentralized control scheme which only requires the individual buildings to communicate bounds on their energy demands. The proposed method partly alleviates concerns on privacy since this limited communication scheme does not reveal the exact characteristics of the energy usage within each building. In addition, it enables a distributed computation of the solution, making our method highly scalable. We demonstrate through a numerical study the efficacy of the proposed approach, which leads to solutions that closely approximate those obtained by the centralized formulation only at a fraction of the computational effort.},

	abstract = {Information about the patterns that govern the energy demand and onsite generation can generate significant savings in the range of 15–30\% in most cases and thus is essential for the management of commercial building energy systems. Predominantly, heating and cooling in a building as well as the availability of solar and wind energy are directly affected by variables such as temperature, humidity and solar radiation. This makes energy management decision making and planning sensitive to the prevalent and future weather conditions. Research attempts are being made using a variety of statistical or physical algorithms to predict the evolution of the building load or generation in order to optimise the building energy management. The response of the building energy system to changes in weather conditions is inherently challenging to predict; nevertheless numerous methods in the literature describe and utilise weather predictions. Such methods are being reviewed in this study and their strengths, weaknesses and applications in commercial buildings at different prediction horizons are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of considering weather forecasting inputs in energy management systems is established by highlighting the dependencies of various building components on weather conditions. The issues of the difficulty in implementation of integrated weather forecasts at commercial building level and the potential added value through energy management optimisation are also addressed. Finally, a novel framework is proposed that utilises a range of weather variable predictions in order to optimise certain commercial building systems.},

Multiple energy systems (MES) yields an increase on the efficiency and flexibility of energy supply. The coupling between different forms of energy bring difficulties in the planning of the overall energy system. This paper proposes a novel optimal planning method for a community level MES that jointly determines the optimal generation, conversion and delivery of electricity, heat, cooling, and other services. First, configuration planning of a community level MES is introduced and defined using the energy hub (EH) concept. Then, the planning problem is presented with the objective of minimizing the sum of the investment and operating costs, with variables that represent the selection of energy converters or storage and their relationships. The model is then formulated asa mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem based on graph theory. The proposed model does not requires any pre-assumptions on the configurations of the EH so that it can plan the MES starting from scratch. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to describe the functioning of our proposed method. A numerical case study for the planning of a subsidiary administrative center in Beijing, China is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

Noting that the analysis of a heuristic is often based on a linear programming relaxation, we then show how certain heuristics can be integrated into enumeration schemes to produce branch and bound algorithms whose worst case behaviour steadily improves as the enumeration develops. We take the multidimensional knapsack problem, the uncapacitated K-location problem, and the travelling salesman problem as examples.},

	abstract = {A conditional lower bound on the minimand of an integer program is a number which would be a valid lower bound if the constraint set were amended by certain inequalities, also called conditional. If such a conditional lower bound exceeds some known upper bound, then every solution better than the one corresponding to the upper bound violates at least one of the conditional inequalities. This yields a valid disjunction, which can be used to partition the feasible set, or to derive a family of valid cutting planes. In the case of a set covering problem, these cutting planes are themselves of the set covering type. The family of valid inequalities derived from conditional bounds subsumes as a special case the Bellmore-Ratliff inequalities generated via involutory bases, but is richer than the latter class and contains considerably stronger members, where strength is measured by the number of positive coefficients. We discuss the properties of the family of cuts from conditional bounds, and give a procedure for generating strong members of the family. Finally, we outline a class of algorithms based on these cuts. Our approach was implemented and extensively tested in a computational study whose results are reported in a companion paper [2]. The algorithm that emerged from the testing seems capable of solving considerably larger set covering problem than earlier methods.},

In answer to (i) we present one possible procedure, and discuss the cutting stock and travelling salesman problems from this point of view. Noting that the analysis of a heuristic is often based on a linear programming relaxation, we then show how certain heuristics can be integrated into enumeration schemes to produce branch and bound algorithms whose worst case behaviour steadily improves as the enumeration develops. We take the multidimensional knapsack problem, the uncapacitated K-location problem, and the travelling salesman problem as examples.},

	abstract = {Mixed integer linear programming is one of the main approaches used to solve unit commitment problems. Due to the computational complexity of unit commitment problems, several researches remark the benefits of using less binary variables or relaxing them for the branch-and-cut algorithm. However, integrality constraints relaxation seems to be case dependent because there are many instances where applying it may not improve the computational burden. In addition, there is a lack of extensive numerical experiments evaluating the effects of the relaxation of binary variables in mixed integer linear programming based unit commitment. Therefore, the primary purpose of this work is to analyze the effects of binary variables and compare different relaxations, supported by extensive computational experiments. To accomplish this objective, two power systems are used for the numerical tests: the IEEE118 test system and a very large scale real system. The results suggest that a direct link between the relaxation of binary variables and computational burden cannot be easily assured in the general case. Therefore, relaxing binary variables should not be used as a general rule-of-practice to improve computational burden, at least, until each particular model is tested under different load scenarios and formulations to quantify the final effects of binary variables on the specific UC implementation. The secondary aim of this work is to give some preliminary insight into the reasons that could be supporting the binary relaxation in some UC instances.},

	abstract = {As an integral feature of a future smart grid, demand response (DR) provides utility companies an emerging alternative to boost the reliability performance (e.g., supply adequacy) of power systems. Unlike for physical devices, the availability of DR is not only dependent on the operations of electric appliances on the demand side but can be affected by customers’ behaviors. Thus, how or to what extent DR actions can affect power system reliability becomes an important issue for utilities. In this paper, a new approach for assessing the contribution of incentive-based DR to the supply adequacy of smart distribution systems (SDS) is presented. Compared with existing methods, our method explicitly captures the varying availability of customer DR capabilities. We introduce a behavior-reinforcement procedure to model the correlation of users’ participation willingness with their historical DR profitability. Then, a strategic DR dispatch strategy can be developed to optimize users’ DR availability bids in the market. In addition, the interdependency between a communication system and DR operation has also been considered. A hybrid algorithm based on sequential Monte-Carlo simulation and an optimal load dispatch method is employed to evaluate the system reliability in this context. The proposed approach is illustrated using both a small-scale test case and a real regional distribution grid in China. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration level of renewable energy requires more flexibility measures to be implemented in future energy systems. Integrating an energy consumer’s local energy supplies connects multiple energy networks (i.e., the electrical grid, the district heating network, and gas network) in a decentralized way. Such integration enhances the flexibility of energy systems. In this work, a Swedish office building is investigated as a case study. Different components, including heat pump, electrical heater, battery and hot water storage tank are integrated into the electricity and heat supply system of the building. Special focus is placed on the flexibility that the studied building can provide to the electrical grid (i.e., the building modulates the electricity consumption in response to the grid operator’s requirements). The flexibility is described by two metrics including the flexibility hours and the flexibility energy. Optimization of the component capacities and the operation profiles is carried out by using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The results show that the system fully relies on electricity for the heat demand when not considering the flexibility requirements of the electrical grid. This suggests that district heating is economically unfavorable compared with using electricity for the heat demand in the studied case. However, when flexibility requirements are added, the system turns to the district heating network for part of the heat demand. The system provides great flexibility to the electrical grid through such integration. The flexibility hours can be over 5200 h in a year, and the flexibility energy reaches more than 15.7 MWh (36\% of the yearly electricity consumption). The yearly operation cost of the system slightly increases from 62,273 to 65,178 SEK when the flexibility hours increase from 304 to 5209 h. The results revealed that flexibility can be provided from the district heating network to the electrical grid via the building.},

They can be coupled with thermal energy storage (TES) systems to shift electrical loads from high-peak to off-peak hours, thus serving as a powerful tool in demand-side management (DSM). This paper analyzes heat pumps with radiators or underfloor heating distribution systems coupled with TES with a view to showing how a heat pump system behaves and how it influences the building occupants' thermal comfort under a DSM strategy designed to flatten the shape of the electricity load curve by switching off the heat pump during peak hours (16:00–19:00). The reference scenario for the analysis was Northern Ireland (UK). The results showed that the heat pump is a good tool for the purposes of DSM, also thanks to the use of TES systems, in particular with heating distribution systems that have a low thermal inertia, e.g. radiators. It proved possible to achieve a good control of the indoor temperature, even if the heat pump was turned off for 3 h, and to reduce the electricity bill if a “time of use” tariff structure was adopted.},

We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different “P2Y”-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To “functionalize” or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context.

This is particularly interesting in applications for industrial, commercial and education buildings where keeping the indoor air quality under control is extremely important. Experimental measurements show that, throughout the year, the outside air temperature fluctuations are mitigated at sufficient ground depth (about 3 m) because of the high thermal inertia of the soil, the ground temperature is relatively constant and instead higher than that of the outside air in winter and lower in summer. The study aims to numerically investigate the behavior of HAGHE by varying the air flow rate and soil conductivity in unsteady conditions by using annual weather data of South-East Italy. The analysis shows that, in warm climates, the HAGHE brings a real advantage for only a few hours daily in winter, while it shows significant benefits in the summer for the cooling of ventilation air up to several temperature degrees, already by a short pipe.},

	abstract = {Demand Side Management (DSM) provides ancillary service to the electric grid by modifying customers electricity demand. Demand Response (DR) and Demand Flexibility (DF) programs from buildings are well-adopted ancillary services to reduce the peak demand in grids by altering the power consumption strategy. Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems are one of the largest energy demands in commercial buildings. In addition, HVAC systems are flexible to provide DR service to the grid. In this study, two common configuration topologies of building integration with Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and renewables are considered. A real-time optimization framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed to control the power flow from the grid, solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels, and ESS to a commercial building with HVAC systems. The MPC framework uses the inherent thermal mass storage of the building and the ESS as a means to provide DR. Deterministic and probabilistic analysis are studied to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on Building-to-Grid (B2G) systems. Our deterministic results show that the proposed optimization and control framework for B2G systems can significantly reduce the maximum load ramp-rate of the electric grid to prevent duck-curve problems associated with increase in solar PV penetration into the grid. Based on probabilistic results, even under prediction uncertainties, electricity cost saving and ramp-rate reduction is achievable. The results show that this DR service does not affect the building indoor climate in a way noticeable to humans and its effect on the operational building costs is reduced. The B2G simulation testbed in this paper is based on the experimental data obtained from an office building, PV panels, and battery packs integrated with a three-phase unbalanced distribution test feeder. A Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out to account for uncertainties of the proposed method. Both deterministic and stochastic analyses show the effectiveness of the proposed predictive power flow control to decrease the building operation electricity costs and load ramp-rates.},
